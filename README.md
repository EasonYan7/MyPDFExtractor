## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

1. **OCR Requirement**  
   - The application extracts selectable text only. Scanned PDFs need OCR processing before selection.

2. **Performance on Large PDFs**  
   - For very large files, the rendering might take longer.

3. **Coordinate Scaling**  
   - Selections are based on the displayed scale; ensure consistency across PDFs.
